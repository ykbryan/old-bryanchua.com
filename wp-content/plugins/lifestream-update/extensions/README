Please see the included wpcodex extension for an example of how to create a custom extension and include it.

Extensions should in the following format:

	extensions/<name>/
	extensions/<name>/extension.inc.php -- define your extension class here
	extensions/<name>/icon.png -- 16x16 identifying image

You may include multiple classes in extension.inc.php, but without overriding get_icon_url they will all try to use icon.png.

Your class must still be registered using the following line of code:

	$lifestream->register_feed('ClassName');

Also, please fill out the AUTHOR constant in your plugin. It will be modified as changes are submitted:

	class LifeStream_WoWArmoryFeed extends LifeStream_Feed {
		const ID			= 'wowarmory';
		const NAME			= 'WoW Armory';
		const URL			= 'http://www.wowarmory.com/';
		const DESCRIPTION	= 'Display your character\'s Activity feed. (Achievement, Boss Kills, Loot)';
		const AUTHOR		= '<Put your name in here, as well as any names who committed to this extension>'
	}
